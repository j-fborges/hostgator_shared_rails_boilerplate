A legacy Rails 5.0.5 boilerplate using Ruby 2.4.10, tailored to work within the tight constraints of HostGator Shared Hosting plans. This project is designed to be used with the companion HostGator Shared Plans Docker environment for seamless pre-bundling, testing, and deployment.

## 📖 Overview

This boilerplate provides a ready-to-run Rails 5.0.5 application configured with a stable gem stack that compiles cleanly on HostGator's legacy infrastructure (CentOS 7, EA Ruby 2.4.10, MySQL 5.7). It serves as a foundation for developers who need to:

- Pre-bundle and compile gems on a matching local environment before uploading to HostGator.
- Test applications locally in an environment identical to production.
- Package entire Ruby projects with all compiled extensions, ready to deploy.
- Avoid runtime compilation failures on the shared host.

## 🔗 Companion Docker Environment

This boilerplate is meant to be used inside the HostGator Shared Plans Docker environment, which replicates HostGator's exact production stack:

```bash
# Clone the Docker environment
git clone https://github.com/j-fborges/hostgator_shared_plans_docker.git
cd hostgator_shared_plans_docker
# Follow its README to set up the environment
./bin/setup.sh
```

## ✨ Features

- Bootstrap-scss with full SCSS support
- jQuery-ujs for unobtrusive JavaScript (Rails 5 standard)
- Turbolinks for faster page navigation
- MySQL database ready with sample configuration
- Puma and Passenger both available as web servers
- Production-ready asset compilation with uglifier-compressor
- Development and Production environment scripts included

## 🚀 Quick Start (with Docker Environment)

### 1. Set up the Docker Environment

```bash
git clone https://github.com/j-fborges/hostgator_shared_plans_docker.git
cd hostgator_shared_plans_docker
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your custom paths
./bin/setup.sh
./bin/start.sh
```

### 2. Clone this Boilerplate Inside the Container

Once inside the container (you'll be dropped into a bash shell after ./bin/start.sh), navigate to:

```bash
 cd /your/projects/folder/
 git clone https://github.com/j-fborges/hostgator_shared_rails_boilerplate.git
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
bundle install
```

### 4. Configure Database

Edit config/database.yml to match your MySQL service. The Docker environment provides a MySQL container with these default credentials:

>development:
>  adapter: mysql2
>  encoding: utf8
>  database: myapp_development
>  username: myapp_user
>  password: myapp_password
>  host: mysql      # service name from docker-compose
>  port: 3306

### 5. Create and Migrate Database

bash bundle exec rails db:create bundle exec rails db:migrate bundle exec rails db:seed # if you have seed data 

### 6. Run the Development Server

```bash
bundle exec rails s -b 0.0.0.0
```

Your app will be accessible from your host machine at http://127.0.0.1:3000.

## 📜 Included Scripts

| Script                        | Purpose |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| deploy-production.sh          | Full production deployment: cleans assets, installs gems, precompiles |
| runDevServer.sh               | Quick development server launcher with proper binding                 |
| set-development-mode.sh       | Switches environment to development (sets RAILS_ENV, cleans if needed)|
| set-production-environment.sh | Switches environment to production (prepares for asset compilation)   |

## 🧪 Development Workflow

1. Make changes to your code inside the mounted rails_hg folder.

2. Run the development server:
 ```bash
 ./runDevServer.sh 
 ```
3. Test your changes at http://localhost:3000.

4. Switch to production mode to test final assets:
 ```bash
 ./set-production-environment.sh
 ./deploy-production.sh
 bundle exec rails s -b 0.0.0.0 -e production 
 ```
5. Switch back to development when done:
 ```bash
 ./set-development-mode.sh
 ```

## 📦 Preparing for HostGator Deployment

The primary goal of this boilerplate + Docker environment is to create a deployable package that runs on HostGator without needing compilation.

### Step 1: Full Production Build

Inside the container, run:

./deploy-production.sh 

This script:
- Sets RAILS_ENV=production
- Cleans old assets (tmp/cache/assets, public/assets)
- Configures Bundler for production (--without development test)
- Installs all gems (compiles native extensions)
- Precompiles all assets using uglifier compressor
- Packages everything for shipping

### Step 2: Upload to HostGator

Use SCP/SFTP to upload the tarball to your HostGator account and extract it in your home directory.
